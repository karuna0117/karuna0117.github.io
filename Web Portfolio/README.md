                                                   About The Website
I made a website of desserts and in that i used bootstrap classes in it.Bootstrap classes are easy to use as we do not have to make css because bootstrap already has a functionality of responsiveness.For example, I used jumbotron, carousel,card-deck and many other classes to make a website good as it consumes less time also.

                                      
                                    Problems faced during project and how I overcame from that
Usually while making website I faced mostly margin and padding so for that i have to use css to adjust but css coding helps in a easy way.

I used images as it is a protfolio and i applied a grow and shrink property according to the requirement.
My website name is Ice cream which i created in the form of logo.
I used column layout for my menu images.
